        <li><b>Low self-esteem:</b> using drugs to feel more confident or escape insecurity.</li>

    <h3>What Are the Effects of Drug Overdose?</h3>
    <p>
      Taking drugs might seem like a way to have fun, escape stress, or fit in. But the truth is, a drug 
      overdose can turn your life upside down — or even end it — in ways you might never expect.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Severe Physical Damage:</b> your heart, lungs, liver, and brain can stop working properly.</li>
      <li><b>Breathing slows down:</b> which can cause brain damage or death within minutes.</li>
      <li><b>Emotional and Mental Breakdown:</b> overdosing can trigger severe anxiety, hallucinations, or depression, making life even harder.</li>
    </ul>
