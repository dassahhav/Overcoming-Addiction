    <ul>
      <li><b>Join a Local Gym or Boxing Club</b>
        <p>Burn off stress, get stronger, stay distracted in a healthy way. You don't need to be fit to start, gym is a chill & no judgement place.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Surround yourself with people who don't do any type of drugs.</b>
        <p>Hanging out with people who do drugs will make you want to go back into that habit, instead find others who don't do drugs for entertainment.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Change your routine</b>
        <p>Don't focus on quitting all at once, focus on disrupting the pattern.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Replace the high with something else.</b>
        <p>Find something you enjoy doing that gives a similar release.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Set one realistic goal.</b>
        <p>Instead of thinking you should quit forever, just start off with maybe one week sober and go from there.</p>

    <p>
      You don’t have to "go to rehab" or “fix everything” overnight. You just need to do something different today — even if it’s small. 
      Do it for future you. Do it for your little siblings. Do it for your peace. You’ve got this. Real ones make change.
