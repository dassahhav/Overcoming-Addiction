          <h3>What are the effects over drug overdose?</h3>
          <p>Taking drugs might seem like a way to have fun, escape stress, or fit in. But the truth is, a drug 
            overdose can turn your life upside down or even end it in ways you might never expect.</p>
            <li><b>You could stop breathing - </b> Overdosing on drugs causes your lungs to shut down, which means no oxygen gets to your brain.
              Even a few minutes of no oxygen can cause permanent brain damage, or worse death.</li>
            <li><b>Your heart can fail  - </b> Drugs can cause your heart to beat too fast, too slow, or maybe not at all.
            When you heart stops, your whole body shuts down too.</li>
            <li><b>It can affect your relationships with others - </b> Overdose can affect those around you because 
            it can hurt people who care about you and break their trust</li>
            <li></li>
